# RayCollision

RayCollision is an open-source user script for RayStation designed to aid treatment planners in the choice of beam incidence angles that do not collide with the patient or couch.
It loads a 3D model of a LINAC into RayStation, that can be rotated interactively to assess colission risk.
It is written in the native IronPython scripting language of the RayStation interface.
